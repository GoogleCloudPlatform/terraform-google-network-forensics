# This script updates the packages and installs new packages that are required for the Zeek installation.
# After the packages are installed, the Zeek repository is cloned and installed.
# After the installation, it copies custom Zeek scripts to their respective directory and appends the content to the "local.zeek" file for loading custom Zeek scripts.
# Further, it adds Zeek path to environment variables and starts the ZeekControl (a tool for operating Zeek installations) to manage Zeek.
